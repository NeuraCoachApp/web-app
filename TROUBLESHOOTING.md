# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues

### 1. "Database error saving new user" during signup

**Cause**: This happens when there are database triggers that fail during user creation.

**Quick Fix**:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Run the cleanup migration first:
```sql
-- Clean up any existing problematic triggers
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS create_profile_trigger ON auth.users;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS create_profile_for_user();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_new_user();
```
3. Try signing up again

**Permanent Fix**: 
1. Run `000_cleanup_existing_triggers.sql` first
2. Then run `001_create_profiles_with_trigger.sql` for the new trigger setup
3. This will automatically create profiles when users sign up

### 2. Stuck on "Loading..." or "Please wait..." forever

**Cause**: This usually happens when the profiles table hasn't been set up in your Supabase database.

**Solution**: 
- The app will now work without the profiles table
- Check the browser console for warnings about missing profiles table
- To fully set up profiles, run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard

### 3. Profile-related features not working

**Cause**: Profiles table not created in database.

**Solution**:
1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "SQL Editor"
4. Run the migration from `supabase/migrations/001_create_profiles_table_simple.sql`

### 4. Voice recognition not working

**Possible causes and solutions**:
- **Browser not supported**: Use Chrome, Edge, or Safari
- **HTTPS required**: Voice recognition requires HTTPS (works on localhost)
- **Microphone permissions**: Allow microphone access when prompted
- **ElevenLabs API issues**: Check your API key in `.env.local`

### 5. Other Authentication issues

**Common fixes**:
- Check your Supabase URL and anon key in `.env.local`
- Verify your Supabase project is active
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

## Development Setup

### Quick Start (without profiles)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will work for basic auth and onboarding, with profile features gracefully disabled.

### Full Setup (with profiles)
1. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`
2. Run the database migration in Supabase (use the simple version)
3. Start the development server

### Testing Authentication
1. Go to `/auth`
2. Create a new account
3. You should be redirected to onboarding (or dashboard if profiles aren't set up)

## Error Messages

### "Database error saving new user"
- **Run the quick fix above** to remove problematic triggers
- This is usually caused by database triggers failing

### "Profiles table not set up"
- **Safe to ignore** if you haven't run the migration yet
- App will work without profiles, just won't save names

### "Microphone permission denied"
- Click the microphone icon in your browser's address bar
- Allow microphone access
- Refresh the page and try again

### "Speech recognition not supported"
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Ensure you're on HTTPS or localhost
